## Introduction

**PC Agent** introduces a novel framework to empower autonomous digital agents through **human cognition transfer**. 
This transfer is implemented through three key components: 
1. **PC Tracker**, the first lightweight infrastructure for large-scale human-computer interaction data collection;
2. A **Cognition Completion** postprocess pipeline that transforms raw interaction data into cognitive trajectories;
3. A multi-agent system combining a planning agent for decision-making with a grounding agent for robust visual grounding.
